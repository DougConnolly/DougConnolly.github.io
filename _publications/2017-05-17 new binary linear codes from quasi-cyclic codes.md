excerpt: 'Explicit construction of linear codes with best possible parameters is one of the major problems in coding theory. Among all alphabets of interest, the binary alphabet is the most important one. In this work we use a comprehensive search strategy to find new binary linear codes in the well-known and intensively studied class of quasi-cyclic (QC) codes.'
