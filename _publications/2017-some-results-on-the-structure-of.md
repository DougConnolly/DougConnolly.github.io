excerpt: 'One of the most important and challenging problems in coding theory is to construct codes with good parameters. There are various methods to construct codes with the best possible parameters. A promising and fruitful approach has been to focus on the class of quasi-twisted (QT) codes which includes constacyclic codes as a special case. '

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
